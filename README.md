Folder structure

--  classes, templates will go in here eg, data structure declarations
--  controller, this is clear enough
--  styles.css is the main file, I'm gonna delete the other one
--  routes, we gonna have a single route file, others will be declared in the controller and required here
--  services, will hold functions that will be used through out by the application, like database files, sessions contollers(***)
--  views, each page has its own folder, and for compound pages (like users), we may have sub folders
